<blockquote>We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace.<br>
― Chuck Palahniuk, Diary</blockquote>

I want to better understand happiness — what it is, what it entails, and if it is possible to sustain it. I want to use data, especially from external sources, since they can provide new insights to something that feels very internal and seems commonsensical. The hope is that in the process of examining the data, I get to question my own set of assumptions, and consequently expand, my own notions about happiness.

As this promises to be a long-term project, I plan on starting my journey using the [World Happiness Reports](https://worldhappiness.report/), which provides a quantified, high-level overview of the subject. The idea is to take something universalized and turn it into something quite personal.
